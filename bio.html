    <!-- <h3>ABOUT</h3> -->
    <p class="about">
      I am a computational designer and VR/AR developer. <br><br>

      I am interested in the way the AEC industry can leverage new technology to create better designs.
      I have lived all over the world, and worked in several different architectural offices. 
      I graduated with a B.Arch from Auburn University in 2016, with a year abroad in New Zealand.
      Recently I have participated in half a dozen Hackathons and won a awards at five of them. <br><br>
    
      I currently work primarily in JavaScript, C#, and Python. 
      With JavaScript, I’ve designed and deployed numerous web applications and deployments leveraging THREE.js for front-end interfaces. 
      With C#, I have developed a number of application add-ins, and other utilities with a specialization in AR/VR in Unity3d. 
      With Python, I support firm-wide visual programming scripting and development workflows by offering training and support to the rest of the office.
